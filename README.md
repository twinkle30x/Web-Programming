# Web-Programming

A project I created for my Introduction to Web Programming lab. 

Mainly I used HTML and CSS. Php I only used it to import the buttons on each page so I won't have hundreds of lines of code.
And JavaScript I only did the title with it. If you hover it with the mouse pointer it will translate the title into Romanian. 

It's a site for learning the basics of the Chinese Language, and also Register for Chinese Courses.

I just did it for fun because I'm learning Chinese since 2020 and I like to combine my work with my hobbies most of the time.
